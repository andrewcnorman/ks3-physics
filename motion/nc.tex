Pupils should be taught about:

\subsection{Describing motion}
\begin{itemize}
\item speed and the quantitative relationship between average speed, distance and time\\
(speed = distance $\div$ time)
\item the representation of a journey on a distance-time graph
\item relative motion: trains and cars passing one another.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Forces and motion}
\begin{itemize}
\item forces being needed to cause objects to stop or start moving, or to change their speed
or direction of motion (qualitative only)
\item change depending on direction of force and its size.
\end{itemize}
