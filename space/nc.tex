Pupils should be taught about:

\begin{itemize}
\item gravity force, $\text{weight} = \text{mass}\times\text{gravitational field strength (g)}$, on Earth $g=\SI{10}{N/kg}$,
different on other planets and stars; gravity forces between Earth and Moon, and
between Earth and Sun (qualitative only)
\item our Sun as a star, other stars in our galaxy, other galaxies
\item the seasons and the Earthâ€™s tilt, day length at different times of year, in different
