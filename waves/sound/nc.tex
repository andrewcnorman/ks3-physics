Pupils should be taught about:

\subsection{Sound waves}
\begin{itemize}
\item frequencies of sound waves, measured in hertz (Hz); echoes, reflection and absorption
of sound
\item sound needs a medium to travel, the speed of sound in air, in water, in solids
\item sound produced by vibrations of objects, in loud speakers, detected by their effects on
microphone diaphragm and the ear drum; sound waves are longitudinal
\item auditory range of humans and animals.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Energy and waves}
\begin{itemize}
\item pressure waves transferring energy; use for cleaning and physiotherapy by ultra-sound;
waves transferring information for conversion to electrical signals by microphone.
\end{itemize}
