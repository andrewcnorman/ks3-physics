Pupils should be taught about:

\begin{itemize}
\item electric current, measured in amperes, in circuits, series and parallel circuits, currents
add where branches meet and current as flow of charge
\item potential difference, measured in volts, battery and bulb ratings; resistance, measured
in ohms, as the ratio of potential difference (p.d.) to current
\item differences in resistance between conducting and insulating components (quantitative).
\end{itemize}
