Pupils should be taught about:

\subsection{Calculation of fuel uses and costs in the domestic context}
\begin{itemize}
\item comparing energy values of different foods\\ (from labels) (kJ)
\item comparing power ratings of appliances in watts\\ (W, kW)
\item comparing amounts of energy transferred\\ (J, kJ, kW hour)
\item domestic fuel bills, fuel use and costs
\item fuels and energy resources.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Energy changes and transfers}
\begin{itemize}
\item  simple machines give bigger force but at the expense of smaller movement (and vice
versa): product of force and displacement unchanged
\item heating and thermal equilibrium: temperature difference between two objects leading to
energy transfer from the hotter to the cooler one, through contact (conduction) or
radiation; such transfers tending to reduce the temperature difference: use of insulators
\item other processes that involve energy transfer: changing motion, dropping an object,
completing an electrical circuit, stretching a spring, metabolism of food, burning fuels.
\subsection{Changes in systems}
\item energy as a quantity that can be quantified and calculated; the total energy has the
same value before and after a change
\item comparing the starting with the final conditions of a system and describing increases
and decreases in the amounts of energy associated with movements, temperatures,
changes in positions in a field, in elastic distortions and in chemical compositions
\item using physical processes and mechanisms, rather than energy, to explain the
intermediate steps that bring about such changes.
\end{itemize}
